# Introduction

## Fundamentals

        console.log("This is a string");
        This will create a log within the console section of a website once inspected.

        alert("This is a string");
        This will create a pop up on the webpage upon loading in or refreshing

        var insertName;
        This will create a variable with the attached name, in this case it will create a variable named insertName. Variable name must contain only letters,digits, or the symbols $ and _ .Also, the first character must not be a digit. However the value of this variable will be undefined until we assigned something to it.

        insertName = "I am a string";
        This will assign the string to the variable we just made. Other data types can also be assigned with the variable, such as strings,integers,arrays,etc. However, only one data type can be attached to a variable. Assigning a new data type will overide the old one.

        const numberOne = 1;
        This will assign the integer 1 to the constant variable numberOne. Unlike normal variables, this cannot be change once it has been defined and by trying to do so will produce an error.

## Combining Fundamentals

<u>Example 1</u>

        var message;
        message = "I am a message";
        alert(message);

        This will alert "I am a message" when entering the webpage or refreshing
